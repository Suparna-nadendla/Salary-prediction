# Salary-prediction
This project creates a web app that predicts salaries for tech jobs using machine learning. Users can enter details like job title, location, and skills, and the app will estimate the salary for that job. It also includes features like showing raw data, creating charts, and uploading files for predicting salaries in bulk.
